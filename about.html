        <div class="row">
            <div><p class="lead">
              <br>  There are several legends that explain the origin of the name of “Catanduanes.” One legend states that Catanduanes comes from the word
                 tandu, a native click beetle that was once abundant throughout the island. “Katanduan” was the reference made of this island that means
                  a place where tandu abound. When the Spaniards came, it was Hispanized to Catanduanes (notice the phonological similarity, except for
                   the additional es in the Spanish version that was probably added to become a pluralist). Another story says that it comes from the word
                    samdong, a tree that abounds this paradise island to which the people would call kasamdongan, meaning a place of samdong. Just like
                     the former legend, the word was Hispanized. The phonological error traces to the Spaniards’ difficulty to pronounce certain words,
                      particularly those ending in ng; hence, from kasamdongan and katandungan, it gradually metamorphosed to Catanduanes. Still some 
                      historians point that katandungan is a Malay word that means “a place of refuge in time of danger,” for indeed, this island has
                       always been the refuge of mariners during stormy weather.
            
               <br> The general referral in the framing of the history of Catanduanes runs parallel to the story of Philippine evangelization. The best 
                source of information on Catanduanes, ex libris canonicus, was lost or destroyed during one of the many incursions of the Moro pirates
                 plying the Bicol Peninsula. In addition to the significant facts from church records, some pieces of information were handed down through
                 word of mouth (be they facts, legends or tales). The important events formed into the significance matrix if only to document the shades
                  of the past of this beautiful and happy island of Catanduanes.
